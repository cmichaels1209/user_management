âœ… DevOps Integration
The project used Docker for containerization, and I integrated GitHub Actions to automatically test and build the application. My final image is available on DockerHub:

âœ… Agile & CI/CD Practices
Daily commits, pull requests, issue tracking, and automated testing mimicked an Agile team workflow. I learned how to adjust plans in response to feedback and maintain continuous delivery.

ðŸŒŸ Final Thoughts
This was the most rewarding academic project Iâ€™ve completed. It went beyond codingâ€”into real software engineering. I now feel confident writing production-ready Python applications, debugging test suites, designing scalable APIs, and managing cloud-based deployments.

Iâ€™m proud of what I built, what I learned, and how I collaborated. Iâ€™ll take these skills and apply them in internships, full-time roles, and future independent projects.
